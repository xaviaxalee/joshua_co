                <p class="mb-4 text-white">My experience as a leader is the account of a series of lessons
                        that the author has learned throughout his career as a
                        leader. Starting from these same teachings lived in first
                        person as leader in various areas, such as schools and local
                        ecclesiastical associations, the author leads us to a series of
                        reflections on the meaning and value of the concept of
                        leadership itself. <br>
                        He describes his role as a leader as a gift and the work done
                        as guided directly by the scriptures. Each chapter analyzes a
                        different thematic node and concludes with a teaching about
                        the value and importance of carrying out a task with wisdom
                        and humility.</p>

                                        I recently come across the book "21 Vital Lessons of Leadership" by the
                                        author George Moore. I really appreciate the work of the writer, it was
                                        enlightening and impressive which makes me optimistic and motivated. The
                                        lessons were all rich but the ones that touch me the most are; Courage,
                                        Hard work, Communication, Allow God in your plan and Creativity.  I
                                        enjoyed the style, arrangement and techniques of the writer, the work is
                                        indeed one in a millions. Once more, thanks and congrats for such an
